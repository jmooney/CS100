	1. Refactor the __init__, __initP__, and __initC__ structure:
		- Ideally each class has one __init__ method
		- Parent classes may use getter functions to give child privelage in setting data (current initC)
		
	2. Refactor the TransformationGraph and SceneGraph
		- Create one underlying tree graph structure, where each 'Graph' provides an interface of functionality
		- Allow for multiple types of graphs such as MessageListener etc..
		
	3. Refactor OpenGL State Groups
		- Create dynamic group-creation and single-referencing system

	5. Scene Object and Primitive Resizing
		- Exactly what it says
		
	4. Clean Comments/Documentation
		- Establish convention for commentation in classes
		
	5. Create batchSubNodes() within Scene Graph.
		- Allows a node to permenantly batch the rendering aspects of lower nodes for optimization
		
	6. Performance optimizations/tests. 
		- Remove 'localPos' in LineDrawing
		- Construct the line horizontally, and rotate the node to the desired position

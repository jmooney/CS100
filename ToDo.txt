Ver 2.00:

	1. Create Collision Detection System
		A) Shape/AABB collision mechanisms
		B) AABB Prune/Sweep Broad Phase
		C) Circle v. Circle
		D) GJK Narrow Phase





Ver 1.00:

	1. COMPLETED - Refactor the __init__, __initP__, and __initC__ structure:
		- Ideally each class has one __init__ method
		- Parent classes may use getter functions to give child privilege in setting data (current initC)
		
	2. COMPLETED - Refactor the TransformationGraph and SceneGraph
		- Create one underlying tree graph structure, where each 'Graph' provides an interface of functionality
		- Allow for multiple types of graphs such as MessageListener etc.
		
	3. HOLD - Refactor OpenGL State Groups
		- Create dynamic group-creation and single-referencing system

	5. COMPLETED - Scene Object and Primitive Resizing
		- Exactly what it says
		
	4. COMPLETED - Clean Comments/Documentation:
		- Establish convention for commentation in classes

	5. HOLD (not supported in pyglet atm) - Create batchSubNodes() within Scene Graph
		- Allows a node to permanently batch the rendering aspects of lower nodes for optimization

	6. COMPLETED - Refactor parent-child drawing dependencies
		- If a node parents another and wishes to take control of child node drawing operations
		- Ex: Sprite and its SceneObject representation
		
	7. CANCELED - Refactor Animation to include 'default' options
		- What do you think?

	8. COMPLETED - Refactor SceneObject and DataSrc:
		- SceneObject should only function on DataSrc objects - CHECK
		- DataSrc should be extended to include custom objects - CHECK
		- SceneObject should automatically update the vertex-lists if the dataSrc updates - CHECK
	
	9. COMPLETED - Refactor file dependences/structure:
		- Relative imports and the like!
		
	10. Refactor TransformNode such that on removal, transforms revert to 'normalized' setup.
